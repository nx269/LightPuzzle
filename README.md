# LightPuzzle

Lights Out is a puzzle game consisting of an n x n grid of lights. At the beginning of the game, some of
the lights are switched on. When a light is pressed, this light and the four adjacent lights are toggled,
i.e., they are switched on if they were off, and switched off otherwise. The purpose of the game is to
switch all the lights off.

During each new game, each light has a 20% chance of being in the on position.

Grid size can be set by navigating to file -> options.
